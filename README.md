Filter that spam!  Simple Chat Cleaner filters out unwated chat messages from specific or all channels!

This addon is a semi-rewrite of CChatCleaner which has been abandoned by the author.  It should filter in the same way (any word from filter 1 AND any word from filter 2).

Configuration: /scc

Options:
    Filter friends/guildies
    Filter /say
    Filter /yell
    Filter all or specific channels
    Match whole or partial words
    Debug output to see which messages are filtered (and why)
    Basic statistics: /scc stats


TODO:
    User specific / global profile (right now it's all global)
    Better stat collection
